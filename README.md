# Pressure Sensor App

This application consists of an initial screen that leads users to a login page. The login feature uses an online Google Firebase database to securely manage and store user accounts. 

Once logged in, users will reach an interface that allows them to visualize data recorded from a pressure sensor. The sensor is connected to an HC-05 Bluetooth module. The interface displays a gauge that fills up as pressure is applied to the sensor, giving users real-time feedback on pressure levels.

## Features
- **Login**: Secure user authentication using Google Firebase.
- **Pressure Visualization**: Real-time pressure data displayed through an interactive gauge.
- **Bluetooth Connectivity**: Pressure sensor data is collected via an HC-05 Bluetooth module.
